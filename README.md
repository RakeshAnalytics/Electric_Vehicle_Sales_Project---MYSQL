# Electric_Vehicle_Sales_Project---MYSQL
This project I  have completed during my one-month internship at Unified Mentor. It analyzes electric vehicle (EV) sales trends across different states, vehicle types, and time periods using MySQL. The analysis provides insights into market growth, seasonal patterns, and future opportunities in the EV industry.
