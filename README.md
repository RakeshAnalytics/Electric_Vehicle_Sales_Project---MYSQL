# Electric_Vehicle_Sales_Project---MYSQL

This project I  have completed during my one-month internship at Unified Mentor. It analyzes electric vehicle (EV) sales trends across different states, vehicle types, and time periods using MySQL. The analysis provides insights into market growth, seasonal patterns, and future opportunities in the EV industry.

Sales trends vary significantly across states, with some states showing rapid adoption over time.

ðŸ”¹ Vehicle Type & Category Analysis:
2W_Personal is the most sold, while Institution Bus is the least sold.
2-wheelers dominate sales over 3-wheelers, indicating a strong demand for personal EVs.

ðŸ”¹ Monthly & Yearly Sales Trends:
November has the highest sales, while February has the lowest.
Sales have grown by [%] from 2022 to 2024, indicating increasing EV adoption.

ðŸ”¹ Market Share & Growth Trends:

                                          ðŸ“¢ Recommendations:

âœ… Expand EV Infrastructure: Increase the number of charging stations, especially in states with growing adoption, to support long-term EV growth.

âœ… Promote 3-Wheeler Adoption: Since 2-wheelers dominate, incentives and subsidies for 3-wheelers could encourage more commercial EV usage.

âœ… Target Low-Sales States: States like Sikkim should be targeted with awareness campaigns and incentives to boost EV adoption.

âœ… Seasonal Sales Strategy: Since November sees the highest sales, launching new EV models and promotional offers during peak months can maximize revenue.

âœ… Government Policy Support: Strengthening EV-friendly policies, such as tax benefits and subsidies, can accelerate growth in emerging markets.

âœ… Sustainability Focus: Encouraging corporate and institutional EV adoption, especially for public transport (e.g., buses), can reduce emissions and promote clean mobility.
